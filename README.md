## Singer SDK Dev Guide

See the [dev guide](../../docs/dev_guide.md) for more instructions on how to use the Singer SDK to 
develop your own taps and targets.

## Config Guide

### Selecting Additional Fields in a Custom Report

To select additional fields in a custom report, pass in a manually modified catalog using a command like `meltano elt tap-bamboohr target-jsonl --catalog=catalog.json`. The `catalog.json` file should be modified such that the field you want to include is marked as available and selected. For example, to add the `zipcode` field to the set of selected fields, change its breadcrumb to the following:

```json
{
    "breadcrumb": [
        "properties",
        "zipcode"
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "inclusion": "available",
        "selected": true
    }
}
```

You can also modify `meltano.yml` by adding metadata, accomplishing the same thing.

```yml
    metadata:
      "CUSTOM REPORT NAME":
        "customFIELDNAME":
          "inclusion": "available"
          "selected": true
```

Alternatively, to modify the tap and permanently add a field to the default set of selected fields, add its name to `tap_bamboohr/selected_fields.json`. Or, if the field exists but is undocumented or not returned by `/meta/fields`, add its name and data type to `tap_bamboohr/merge_fields.json` to have it be merged into the default catalog (but not necessarily selected by default).

### Source Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] `TODO:` If your tap requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.
This Singer-compliant tap was created using the [Singer SDK](https://gitlab.com/meltano/singer-sdk).

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.

Install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-bamboohr
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-bamboohr --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-bamboohr target-jsonl
```

### SDK

Built with the [Meltano SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps and Targets.
